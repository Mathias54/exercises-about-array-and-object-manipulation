/**
 * Make a function which return a newPerson.
 * This newPerson object must have the 'profession' atribute.
 * The index of the person in people represent the prefession of the person.
 * It means, people[0].profession = prefession[0].
 * Make another function which return a array of NewPerson.
 * You can't use numbers to access the index, it needs to be automatic.
 * It means, if I put a new person in people and a new profession in professions the code must know without you change anything.
